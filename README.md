CryptoSuite is a cryptography toolbox designed to provide a set of tools for simple cryptographic tasks. Whether you need frequency analysis for a cipher text, encoding, or basic encryption and decryption, CryptoSuite probably has that tool.

## Features

- Frequency Analysis: Analyze the frequency of characters in a ciphertext to help crack substitution ciphers.

- Encoding and Decoding: Encode and decode messages using popular encoding schemes such as Base64, Hex, etc.

- Symmetric Encryption: Encrypt and decrypt messages using symmetric encryption algorithms like AES and DES.

- Hashing: Generate cryptographic hashes using SHA-256, MD5, and other hashing algorithms.
